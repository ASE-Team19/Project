Travel buddy is an application, one stop to all the requirements for those who loves to travel. Now in a smart world there is requirement for a smart application which provides help to users traveling. Travel buddy provides a unique platform which gives information about weather, accommodation, currency conversions, twitter timelines for activities around you and many more. 

We planned to create an application which has a registration page and login page. For the First time, users are supposed to register for further access. We are also including the social sign in plugins so that any user can login without the hassle of signup/registration forms. Home page has different functionalities such as weather details, hotel search, twitter timeline, translate,  emergency services . etc.
